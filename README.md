## About

Hi, I'm Breann! I have an analytical background in Marketing and currently, I am on track to complete my bachelor's degree in Marketing at the University of Central Florida. Through my studies, I have developed a strong interest in the quantitative and analytical sides of the marketing/business sector and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. Alongside my studies, I am learning tools such as SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Python. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems. I am excited to keep learning and developing both my technical and creative skills in the data field.
